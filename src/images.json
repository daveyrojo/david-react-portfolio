If given the opportunity to work for you I'll bring the same team spirit and the same competetive edge!"

I have gone through my Rutgers FS Coding Bootcamp while being a new dad - while my wife works fulltime! I am an extremely lucky guy for having the amazing ladies in my life, but I'm a firm believer that you make your own luck through hardwork and staying focused. That's what you can expect out of me if we work together in the future!"
